# DSW Registration Kiosk App

This is an iOS (iPad-only) app that contains a framed-in browser locked to the DSW site in simple registration mode for use in kiosks at Basecamp and headline events during the week.

## Getting started

- Clone the repo
- Open the `DSW Kiosk` workspace in Xcode
- Build!

## Deploying

During the week, the kiosk app is deployed via [Meraki Systems Manager](https://meraki.cisco.com/products/systems-manager) into [Single-App Mode](https://documentation.meraki.com/SM/Profiles_and_Settings/Single_App_mode_or_Guided_Access_and_Meraki_MDM).

iPads to be deployed must be added to the provisioning portal in advance of the build to be appropriately added.
